This mastermind game was created using C# where I practiced and learned whatever was lacking as any programmer must do by testing the game repeatedly
the game test the user whith a simple guessing game where he guess 4 numbers and each time he guess the code check whether its correct or not or its in misplaced place as instructed
first i verified the argument to generate the secertCode if no argument it generate random code
second i get the code from user and stored in a array
third i verified two array which to verify that its correct place and well placed
forth if its not then we verify if the number is right but in the wrong place and thats why we use nested loop
and at last if its right we congratulate and if not he loses
